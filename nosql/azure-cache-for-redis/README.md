## Features

- **In-Memory Data Store**: Offers sub-millisecond response times for high-performance applications.
- **Scalability**: Supports scaling up and out to meet application demands.
- **High Availability**: Provides built-in replication and failover capabilities.

## Use Cases

- Caching frequently accessed data to improve application performance.
- Session storage for web applications.
- Real-time analytics and leaderboard tracking.

## Sample Code Snippet

```python
import redis

# Connect to the Azure Cache for Redis
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(
    host='your-redis-endpoint',
    port=6379,
    password='your-redis-password',
    decode_responses=True
)

# Set a value
redis_client.set("key", "value")

# Get a value
value = redis_client.get("key")
print(value)
```

## Security Features

- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with Azure Active Directory integration.
- **Compliance**: Meets standards like ISO, SOC, and GDPR.

## Migration Strategies

- **Data Migration Tool**: Use Redis migration tools for seamless migration.
- **Custom Scripts**: Write custom scripts to migrate data from other caching solutions.

## Performance Tuning

- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize connection management for high-concurrency workloads.
- **Data Partitioning**: Use Redis clustering to distribute data across multiple nodes.
- **Cache Expiration**: Configure expiration policies to manage memory usage effectively.
