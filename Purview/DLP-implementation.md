## Configure Policy Settings

- **Sensitive Information Types**: Choose the types of sensitive information the policy will detect (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers).
- **Conditions**: Set conditions for when the policy should trigger (e.g., when sensitive information is shared externally).
- **Actions**: Define actions to take when a policy violation occurs (e.g., block sharing, send alerts, notify users).

## Test and Deploy the Policy

- **Test Mode**: Initially deploy the policy in test mode to monitor its impact without enforcing actions.
- **Review Results**: Analyze the test results and adjust the policy settings as needed.
- **Enforce Policy**: Once satisfied with the configuration, switch the policy to enforce mode.

## Monitor and Manage Policies

- Regularly review policy performance and adjust settings based on new threats or changes in business needs.
- Use the DLP reports and dashboards to track policy effectiveness and compliance.

## Advanced Configuration (Optional)

- **Endpoint DLP**: Configure settings for endpoint devices to restrict actions like copying, printing, or transferring sensitive data
- **Integration with Microsoft Defender**: Extend DLP alerts to Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection and response
