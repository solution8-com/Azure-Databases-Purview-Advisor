## Features

- **Full Control**: Offers complete OS-level access and control over the SQL Server instance.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various SQL Server editions and configurations to meet specific application needs.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with other Azure services for enhanced functionality.

## Use Cases

- **Lift-and-Shift Migrations**: Ideal for migrating existing SQL Server applications to the cloud without significant changes.
- **Custom Applications**: Suitable for applications requiring specific SQL Server features not available in PaaS offerings.

## Sample Code Snippet

```bash
# Create a new SQL Server VM in Azure
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name mySqlServerVM \
  --image MicrosoftSQLServer:SQL2019-WS2019:latest \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --admin-password myPassword123! \
  --public-ip-address-dns-name mySqlServerVM
```

## Implications of Using SQL Server on Azure VMs vs. PaaS Solutions

> Running SQL Server on Azure VMs (IaaS) gives you **full control** over the OS, SQL Server instance, and configuration—ideal for lift-and-shift scenarios or legacy workloads. In contrast, **PaaS solutions** like Azure SQL Database or Managed Instance abstract away infrastructure management, offering built-in high availability, automated backups, and scalability.

**Key Implications:**

- **Management Overhead**: Azure VMs require patching, backup configuration, and manual HA setup. PaaS handles these automatically.
- **Feature Compatibility**: SQL Server on VMs supports full SQL Server features (e.g., cross-database queries, CLR, SQL Agent), while PaaS may have limitations.
- **Cost and Licensing**: VMs offer BYOL flexibility and predictable costs for long-running workloads. PaaS may be more cost-effective for variable or bursty workloads.
- **Migration Complexity**: VMs are ideal for minimal-change migrations; PaaS may require schema or code refactoring.

## Best Practices for Managing SQL Server on Azure VMs (Backup & DR)

> Managing SQL Server on Azure VMs requires a proactive approach to ensure resilience and recoverability:

- **Backup Strategy**:
  - Use **Azure Backup for SQL Server** to enable centralized, policy-driven backups with point-in-time restore.
  - Ensure **private endpoint integration** for secure backup vault access.
  - Monitor backup performance and adjust VM SKU or disk type if IOPS bottlenecks occur during backup windows.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**:
  - Implement **Always On Availability Groups** across availability zones or regions for high availability and DR.
  - Use **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** to replicate VMs for full-stack failover.
  - For hybrid scenarios, combine **SQL Server Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs)** with ASR or backup-based DR.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Integrate with **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics** to track backup success, job failures, and RPO/RTO compliance.

## Performance Tuning Techniques for SQL Server in a Virtualized Environment

> Running SQL Server in a VM introduces unique performance considerations. Here’s how to optimize:

- **CPU & Memory**:
  - Avoid CPU oversubscription—monitor `% Processor Time` and `Signal Waits`.
  - Disable **memory ballooning** and reserve memory for SQL Server to prevent host-level reclamation.
- **Storage**:
  - Use **Premium SSD v2** or **Ultra Disks** for low-latency, high-throughput workloads.
  - Separate data, log, and TempDB files across multiple disks to parallelize I/O.
- **Networking**:
  - Enable **Accelerated Networking** for reduced latency and jitter.
  - Use **Proximity Placement Groups** to co-locate app and DB tiers.
- **SQL Server Configuration**:
  - Tune `max degree of parallelism`, `cost threshold for parallelism`, and `max server memory` based on workload.
  - Enable **Query Store** to track regressions and optimize plans post-deployment.
- **VM Sizing**:
  - Choose VM SKUs (e.g., **Ebdsv5**, **M-series**) that match your memory and IOPS needs.
  - Monitor TempDB usage and scale accordingly.
