## How to Integrate SQL Server on Azure VM with Purview

### Registering the SQL Server on Azure VM in Purview

- Go to the [Microsoft Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).
- Navigate to **Data Map** > **Register** > **SQL Server on Azure VM**.
- Provide the required connection details (server name, authentication, etc.).
- Set up a scan rule set to define what metadata and classifications to extract.
- Schedule regular scans to keep metadata and classifications up to date.

### Enabling Unity Data Governance

- Use **Unity Catalog** within Purview to manage access policies, data lineage, and data sharing.
- Assign roles such as Data Owner, Data Steward, and Data Consumer to control access and responsibilities.
- Track data movement and transformations for compliance and auditing.

### Data Classification and Labeling

- Apply built-in or custom classifiers to automatically detect and label sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial data).
- Use labels to drive downstream policies such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and access controls.

## Managing DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Projects

> DLP projects in Purview help you identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data within your SQL Server databases hosted on Azure VMs.

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Cross-Region Access Control</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Control export of sensitive data from Azure-hosted SQL Server in Costa Rica to other regions.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Target columns with geo-sensitive data (e.g., address, tax ID) in tables like `CustomerProfiles` or `LocalTaxRecords`.
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Use built-in geography classifiers or custom location filters.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Alert admins when data is queried from outside Costa Rica.  
   - Require approval workflows for cross-region exports.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Track access origin using Purview’s dashboard with IP region mapping.

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Admin Console Activity</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Detect suspicious DLP policy changes or overrides made via elevated SQL Server roles.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Monitor admin actions on high-risk tables or rows marked as classified.
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Audit DDL/DML operations through SQL logs with extended audit policies.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Alert InfoSec team of admin overrides on DLP-protected data.  
   - Flag changes to export rules or policy exceptions.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Enable logging across VM and database layers and correlate in Purview.

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Shadow IT Discovery</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Identify and block unauthorized data movement to unmanaged apps or storage targets.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Focus on exports to unknown endpoints (e.g., personal OneDrive, rogue FTP servers).
2. **Define Detection Rules:**  
   Use endpoint traffic patterns and Purview integration with Microsoft Defender.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Block data exfiltration to non-whitelisted destinations.  
   - Notify security team and disable user access temporarily.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** View flagged incidents and take remediation actions in Purview.

## Cost Management and Budgeting

> Integrating with Purview introduces additional costs for scanning, classification, and governance. Below is a breakdown and example budget.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Costs may vary based on region, scan frequency, and data volume.
> - Use [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for precise estimates.
> - Set up budgets and alerts in [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/) to avoid overruns.

> **Microsoft Purview Account:**: Billed per vCore-hour and per GB of data processed during scans.
> The pricing structure is based on:
>
> - **Data Map** (capacity units, always-on)
> - **Scanning** (pay-as-you-go, based on vCore usage and scan duration)
> - **Managed Virtual Network** and **API/Data Transfer** costs for cross-cloud governance
> - **Resource Set Processing** (based on processing time)

## Best Practices

- **Automate Scans:** Schedule regular scans to keep metadata and classifications current.
- **Least Privilege:** Assign only necessary permissions to users and service principals.
- **Monitor Usage:** Regularly review Purview dashboards for unusual activity or policy violations.
- **Review Costs:** Monitor Purview and SQL Server on Azure VM usage to optimize resource allocation and control expenses.

## Integration with Purview for Unity Catalog

> SQL Server on Azure VM can be integrated with Microsoft Purview to enable a Unity Catalog for data governance and management. This integration allows you to:

- Discover and classify sensitive data.
- Track data lineage across your SQL Server databases hosted on Azure VMs.
- Enable centralized data governance.

### Steps to Integrate

1. **Register the SQL Server Database**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Purview portal.
   - Register your SQL Server on Azure VM as a data source.
2. **Scan the Data Source**:
   - Configure scanning rules to classify and catalog the data.
   - Schedule periodic scans to keep the catalog updated.
3. **Manage Data Lineage**: Use Purview to visualize data lineage across your SQL Server databases.
4. **Set Up Access Policies**: Define access policies for data governance using Purview.

### Benefits

- Enhanced data discovery and classification.
- Improved compliance and governance.
- Centralized management of data assets.
