# Azure SQL Managed Instance - Overview

Last updated: 2025-07-17

----------

> Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully managed SQL Server instance that provides near-complete compatibility with on-premises SQL Server. It is designed to simplify the migration of existing applications to the cloud without requiring code changes.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Migration**: Allows for easy migration from on-premises SQL Server environments with minimal changes.
- **Managed Service**: Automates routine tasks such as backups, patching, and monitoring, reducing operational overhead.
- **Compatibility**: Supports SQL Server Agent, linked servers, and cross-database transactions, making it suitable for enterprise applications.

## Use Cases

- Ideal for enterprise app migrations from legacy environments.
- Suitable for applications that require SQL Server features not available in Azure SQL Database.

## Sample Code Snippet

```sql
-- Sample SQL code to create a new database in Azure SQL Managed Instance
CREATE DATABASE SampleDatabase;

-- Sample SQL code to create a table
USE SampleDatabase;
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    HireDate DATE
);

-- Sample SQL code to insert data into the table
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15');
```

## Differences Between Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database

> **Managed Instance** is best for enterprises needing familiar SQL Server behavior and multi-database capabilities with minimal rework.
> These two PaaS options from Azure differ significantly in functionality and ideal use case.

| Feature | Azure SQL Database | Azure SQL Managed Instance |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Deployment | Single database or elastic pool | Instance-level deployment with full SQL Server compatibility |
| Feature Parity | Limited subset of SQL Server features | Nearly full parity (e.g., CLR, Agent, Service Broker) |
| Cross-Database Queries | Not supported | Fully supported |
| SQL Server Agent | Not available | Fully available |
| Use Cases | Cloud-native apps | Lift-and-shift of legacy SQL workloads |
| Linked Servers | Unsupported | Supported |

## Implications of Using SQL Server Agent in a Managed Instance

> This support is particularly useful when trying to preserve automation behavior after migration from on-premises environments.
> SQL Server Agent is built into Azure SQL Managed Instance, bringing robust automation capabilities:

- **Job Scheduling**: Automate backups, ETL workflows, maintenance, or monitoring jobs using tried-and-true T-SQL.
- **Migration Benefits**: Existing Agent jobs from on-prem SQL Server can be migrated with few or no changes.
- **Operational Limits**: Managed Instance restricts job history retention (1,000 total records, 100 per job), and certain advanced configurations are not exposed.
- **Workarounds**: Persist job logs externally or leverage native alerting/telemetry in tandem with Azure Monitor or Log Analytics for rich insights.

## Performance Considerations When Migrating Large Databases to Azure SQL Managed Instance

> Fine-tuning post-migration with **Query Store**, **automatic tuning**, and **indexing insights** helps stabilize workloads and improve long-term performance.
> Successfully lifting large enterprise databases to MI requires foresight:

- **Establish a Baseline**: Measure CPU, memory, IOPS, query wait stats, and plan cache usage on source before the move.
- **Choose the Right Tier**:
  - *General Purpose*: Remote storage; good for most workloads.
  - *Business Critical*: Local SSDs; better IOPS and lower latency for heavy OLTP systems.
- **TempDB Monitoring**: Keep an eye on TempDB size, contention, and latency—it’s critical for workloads with sorts, joins, or intermediate result sets.
- **Resource Scaling**: Monitor performance post-migration and scale vCores and memory based on workload pressure.
- **Migration Tactics**:
  - Use **backup/restore to Azure Blob Storage** for full database fidelity.
  - Or use **Azure DMS with continuous sync** for minimal downtime transitions.
